      <h2>Why Convertrex Exists</h2>
      <p>
        Because brands were sleepwalking. Emails were bloated, boring, and begging to be archived.
        Conversions? Flatlined. Convertrex was born outta pure frustration â€” tired of seeing businesses
        leave money on the table with copy that felt like homework.
      </p>
      <p>
        We knew email had the power to stop scrolling thumbs mid-air. With the right tone, urgency,
        and structure, your inbox could become a revenue weapon. Thatâ€™s what Convertrex is here to do:
        Wake readers up. Win their trust. Get that click.
